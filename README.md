# Space Slide Puzzle 

The space slide puzzle is unique because the puzzle board rotates as the user tries to solve it. This adds a layer of difficulty, best for experienced puzzle players. The rotating speed can be easily adjusted with the slider. If needed the user can turn off the rotating feature by setting the slider to the lowest setting. When the puzzle is completed the app transitions to show an animation of the solar system!
